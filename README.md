## 1. Java Syntax <a name="java-syntax"></a>
In this lab, I studied the syntax of the Java programming language. I learned about variables, data types, control structures, loops, and conditional statements.

## 2. Java Inheritance <a name="java-inheritance"></a>
In this lab, I delved into understanding and implementing inheritance in Java. I learned about superclass, subclass, and how to override methods in the subclass.

## 3. Getters and Setters <a name="getters-and-setters"></a>
This lab focused on understanding and implementing getters and setters in Java. I learned why encapsulation is important and how to control access to class members.

## 4. Cloning <a name="cloning"></a>
In this lab, I learned about cloning objects in Java. I explored both shallow and deep cloning and their implications in object duplication.

## 5. Console Interface <a name="console-interface"></a>
This lab involved creating a console-based interface for a Java program. I learned how to interact with a user through the command line and handle user input.

## 6. Collections and Error Handling <a name="collections-and-error-handling"></a>
In this lab, I delved into the world of collections in Java. I learned about ArrayLists, Maps, and other collection classes. Additionally, I explored error handling techniques using try-catch blocks.

## 7. Object Persistence <a name="object-persistence"></a>
This lab focused on persisting objects in Java. I learned how to write objects to a file and read them back using serialization and deserialization techniques.

## 8. Program "Run" Interface <a name="running-program-with-run-interface"></a>
In this lab, I developed a program "Run" with interface. This is a program for calculating runner statistics.
